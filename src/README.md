This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). This project is designed to work with GTFS (General Transit Feed Specification) data.

## Getting Started

First, ensure you have a PostgreSQL database set up with the appropriate schema. You can find the schema definitions in `src/db/schema/gtfs_schedule.ts`.

To seed the database with data, use the `seedTable` function found in `src/db/seedTable.ts`.

Once your database is set up, you can start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
